SnapshillBot is a bot that archives posts in subreddits that the mods have requested the bot to run in. It uses a variety of different archiving services such as [archive.is](https://www.archive.is), [archive.org](https://www.archive.org), [megalodon.jp](http://megalodon.jp), and for reddit links, [Ceddit](http://www.ceddit.com).

The bot only posts on subreddits where the moderators have requested its presence. Have more questions? Check out [the faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/SnapshillBot/wiki/faq) and if that doesn't answer your question, make a post.

**Requests for adding subreddits are currently being suspended. We'll try to update you on the status of requests soon.**
